# Structured expression navigation in ZLE

This zsh plugin allows you to move the cursor on your zsh commandline
forward / backward one shell argument at a time. Where normally zsh
allows you to move by "words", this will let you skip over whole
arguments, including quotes.

If you're familiar with emacs's `forward-sexp` and `backward-sexp`
commands, this is exactly it.
